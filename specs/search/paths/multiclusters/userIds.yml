    Assign or Move a userID to a cluster.

    The time it takes to migrate (move) a user is proportional to the amount of data linked to the userID.

    Upon success, the response is 200 OK.

    A successful response indicates that the operation has been taken into account, and the userID is directly usable.

    The data returned will usually be a few seconds behind real time, because userID usage may take up to a few seconds to propagate to the different clusters.

    Upon success, the response is 200 OK and contains the following userIDs data.
