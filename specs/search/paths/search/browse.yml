  operationId: browse
  summary: Retrieve all index content.
  description: >
    This method allows you to retrieve all index content. It can retrieve up to 1,000 records per call and supports full text search and filters.

    For performance reasons, some features are not supported, including `distinct`, sorting by `typos`, `words` or `geo distance`.

    When there is more content to be browsed, the response contains a cursor field. This cursor has to be passed to the subsequent call to browse in order to get the next page of results. When the end of the index has been reached, the cursor field is absent from the response.
