  description: |
    `pending` - model has just been created and the pipelines are being set up for the first train & inference. \
    `active` - model is running and generating prediction. \
    `invalid` - model has failed training (ex. canâ€™t retrieve data from source). An additional error field will be set for this status. \
    `inactive` - model has been deactivated from the dashboard. Pipelines still exist but they are not currently running.
